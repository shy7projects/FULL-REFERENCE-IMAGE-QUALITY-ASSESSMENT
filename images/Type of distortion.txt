Type of distortion        

1       Additive Gaussian noise
2       Additive noise in color components is more intensive than additive noise in the luminance component
3       Spatially correlated noise
4       Masked noise
5       High frequency noise
6       Impulse noise
7       Quantization noise
8       Gaussian blur
9       Image denoising
10      JPEG compression
11      JPEG2000 compression
12      JPEG transmission errors
13      JPEG2000 transmission errors
14      Non eccentricity pattern noise
15      Local block-wise distortions of different intensity
16      Mean shift (intensity shift)
17      Contrast change
